Published on June 24, 2021

Over the past 20 years or so since when JavaScript was released, it has become the most 
popular programming language for web development today. 
You can understand the importance of JavaScript as a web development 
language from the fact that as per the recent reports, JavaScript is 
currently being used by more than 94 percent of all the websites 
and the number of people switching to JavaScript are constantly increasing with time. 
JavaScript is a client-side programming language which helps web developer to do Web 
application development and make dynamic and interactive web pages by implementing 
custom client-side scripts. Developers can also use cross-platform runtime engines like 
Node.js to write server-side code in JavaScript. Developers can also create web pages 
which works well across various browsers, platforms, and devices by combining JavaScript, 
HTML5, and CSS3. 
As a matter of fact many popular frameworks are based off of JavaScript. 
By using these frameworks, you can reduce the amount of time and efforts 
required for developing JS based sites and apps which is another reason 
why JavaScript is becoming a popular choice for programmers 
and an asset for many product based companies.

Now lets talk about the advantages and benefits of using JavaScript as your main webdev language :

(1) JavaScript is cross platform compatible meaning, that it is supported by multiple web browsers like 
Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, and Opera etc. 
Hence the users can access the web applications on any web browser of their choice easily. 
They can just enable the JavaScript language if it is disabled and can enjoy all the functionality of the site.

(2) JavaScript provides lots of utility libraries and frameworks. 
JavaScript Frameworks and libraries make it easy for web developers to build large, 
JavaScript-based web applications ( or web pages ). 
For Example ,  AngularJS, ReactJS, etc. JavaScript also has lots of libraries which you 
can use as per your requirements. 
For example, you can do GUI development using widgets like Bootstrap, jQuery or AngularJS.

(3) JavaScript promotes and supports responsive web development. 
Nowadays most developers do responsive web design to make a website accessible 
and work well across multiple browsers and devices like smartphones and desktops. 
Responsive web design enables the developers to optimize the site for both computers 
and mobile devices using the same code. 
The developers have to combine the CSS3, HTML5, and JavaScript to make the web pages responsive. 
The developers can use JavaScript to optimize web pages for mobile devices.

COLCLUSION - From this it is clear that there are several reasons why JavaScript 
has become the most popular programming language in the world among various type of developers. 
JavaScript is an efficient programming language that helps developers in building large scale web 
applications easily and quickly.
